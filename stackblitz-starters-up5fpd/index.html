            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hi there! I'm Sana, a passionate Computer Science and Cybersecurity student with a minor in Business Administration at Southern Connecticut State University. My journey into technology has been shaped by curiosity, 
              resilience, and a drive to make a meaningful impact in the digital world. I graduated from Gateway Community College in Summer 2024, where I honed my foundational skills and developed a deep appreciation for problem-solving 
              and innovation. Recently, I moved to the U.S. to pursue my aspirations and build a thriving career in tech. My goal is to become an FBI Cybersecurity Engineer, where I can protect sensitive information, combat cyber threats, 
              and contribute to national security. I'm particularly fascinated by cutting-edge fields like quantum cryptography, and I aspire to explore its potential to revolutionize cybersecurity. Beyond academics and career ambitions, 
              I am deeply committed to lifelong learning, collaboration, and leveraging technology to connect people and solve complex challenges.

            <h2>What Keeps Me Inspired?</h2>
            <p>
              I love exploring the intersection of technology and human connection, finding innovative ways to make a meaningful impact. 
              From working in IT at Gateway Community College, where I gained hands-on experience managing technical systems and assisting users, 
              to interning at Bigelow Tea, where I honed my skills in ticketing systems, inventory management, and software solutions, these experiences 
              have been invaluable. They have shaped my passion for solving complex problems, creating user-friendly systems, and driving innovation. 
              I am inspired by the power of technology to not only streamline processes but also connect people and create lasting solutions to real-world challenges.
